This module adds an FieldFormatter for an Image field,
which let's you grab the first image from many

Usage:
(1)
After installation of this module you'll get a new
format type "First Image" you can assign to any Image Field
in a Content Type. Just go to the Type's "Manage Display"
and choose "First Image" instead of "Image" from the Format
Combo-Box.

(2)
Same goes for Image Content Fields in Views, choose
"First Image" as format.

Now the first image will be returned
instead of the list of images.
